# Assembly Programming
### Classwork for Assembly / Machine Language using ARM architecture (RasPi)

## Lab 1
Compiled C code into asssembly code for investigation.

## Lab 2
Implemented assembly code that:
1. Computes the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.
1. Computes the greated common denominator of two positive integers.

## Lab 3
Implemented programs that detect overflow:
1. When computing a factorial, if overflow is detected, output a message stating so. Otherwise, output the factorial.
1. When computing the nth term in the fibonacci sequence, if overflow is detected, output the sequence number n where overflow occurred. Otherwise, output the rquested nth term.

## Lab 4
Implemented finding the prime numbers between two integers in three ways:
1. checkPrimeNumber written in assembly and called by a main method written in C
1. checkPrimeNumber written in C and called by a main function in assembly
1. checkPrimeNumber and main are both written in assembly

## Lab 5
Implemented a simulation of the game Battleship
